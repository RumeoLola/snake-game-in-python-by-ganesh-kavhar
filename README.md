RumeoLola -
[Regarding the issue with freegames import, run the unit test script, and it should be successful.
I created a virtual environment for this project to make sure there are not issues with libraries.
And if the tests fail, the should give instructions on what to run.
Also sorry, I'm not so good at writing README files]
